# Add self checking tests.

# handle signal dependency: if r changes then b changes ( e.g. if wire b = r + 1 )

# handle module instantiation - amke sure signals at both module levels are handled
# correctly if they are passed between the modules.

Done
====
 Handle delayed statement.  e.g. #10 r = 1
   - this needs concept of current timescale.  (relative to fs?)
   - so process `timescale commands?
